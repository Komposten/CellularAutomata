================
- Application now enables GL_CULL_FACE and GL_DEPTH_TEST before drawing the GridMesh3D, and disables them afterwards.
- Application now clears the depth buffer using glClear().
- Added various getters to GridMesh3D to more easily track it with the camera.
- Fixed incorrect labelling and colouring of the "planes"/"sides" in Cell3D.
- Fixed the texture coordinates set by Cell3D.
- Fixed GridMesh3D setting maxVertices way too high ("vertices * VALUES_PER_VERTEX" rather than just "vertices").
- GridMesh3D now throws an exception if the requested size is too large (i.e. cannot be fit in a single mesh).
- Added cell and face visibility flags to Cell3D.
- GridMesh3D now hides all Cell faces that are put against each other (visible neighbouring blocks).
- GridMesh3D now uses a FloatArray object to store its vertices, to facilitate future removal and addition of vertices.

================
- Created the abstract Automata class.
- Added GridMesh (similar to IndexGridMesh, but uses only vertices and no indices).
- Added PixPredatoryPrey.
- Added input handling to toggle debug info.
- Added input handling to change between available automata.
- Moved PredatorPrey, PixPredatorPrey and Organism to a separate package.
- Added SimpleEvolution and EvolvingOrganism.
- Added "renderText(BitmapFont)" to Engine and Automata.
- Cameras are now passed to Automata, so that they can control them/chose what camera to use.
- Renamed Automata to Automaton.

- Started working on GridMesh3D and Cell3D. Mesh is created properly and works for singular cells. Multiple cells give culling problems for all cells except the one at (0; 0; 0).

================
- Created the project.
- Added Application, Engine, ShaderFactory, AbstractMesh, Cell, IndexGridMesh, IndexGridMesh, Triangle, Vertex, Organism, and PredatorPrey.
