================
- Created the abstract Automata class.
- Added GridMesh (similar to IndexGridMesh, but uses only vertices and no indices).
- Added PixPredatoryPrey.
- Added input handling to toggle debug info.
- Added input handling to change between available automata.
- Moved PredatorPrey, PixPredatorPrey and Organism to a separate package.
- Added SimpleEvolution and EvolvingOrganism.
- Added "renderText(BitmapFont)" to Engine and Automata.
- Cameras are now passed to Automata, so that they can control them/chose what camera to use.
- Renamed Automata to Automaton.

- Started working on GridMesh3D and Cell3D. Mesh is created properly and works for singular cells. Multiple cells give culling problems for all cells except the one at (0; 0; 0).
